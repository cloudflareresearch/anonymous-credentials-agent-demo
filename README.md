### Issuer

```sh
cd issuer
npm i
npx wrangler deploy
```

### Client

```sh
cd client
npm i
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### MCP Server

The issuer needs to be started for the mcp server to work properly.
The following command starts the MCP inspector to manually trigger tool calls.

```sh
cd act-mcp-server
cargo build
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector cargo run --bin act-mcp-server
```
